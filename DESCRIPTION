Description: 
    Provides a helper function `fetch_externals()` to pull Quarto (.qmd) files 
    from multiple GitHub repositories into a local Quarto site. The manifest-driven 
    workflow resolves the latest release (or a specified ref), downloads files 
    via the GitHub Contents API with ETag caching, injects `source_url` metadata 
    into the YAML front matter, and writes them to the configured destinations. 
    This allows reproducible builds of unified Quarto websites from multiple 
    authoritative repositories.
